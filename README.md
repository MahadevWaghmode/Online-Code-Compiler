Multi-language support: Compile and run code in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++.
Real-time compilation: View results immediately after writing code.
Syntax highlighting: Intuitive code editor with syntax highlighting for each supported language.
Light/Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.
Secure sandboxed environment: Safely compile and execute code.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, Vite, and Chakra UI
Backend: Java Spring Boot and Node.js for API and code execution management
Database: MySQL or MongoDB for storing user preferences and saved code snippets
Code Execution: Docker for sandboxed environment and secure code execution
Screenshots
